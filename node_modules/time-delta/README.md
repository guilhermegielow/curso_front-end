# Node Time Delta

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/time-delta.svg)][repo-npm]
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/betsol/time-delta.svg)][travis]

Formats difference between two dates as a human-readable string in almost any language.

Examples:

- 2 hours, 17 minutes
- 2 hr, 17 min, 10 sec
- 2h 17m 10s
- 1 yr, 4 mths
- 1 year, 4 months, 2 weeks, 5 days, 17 hours, 10 minutes, 10 seconds
- 2 часа; 17 минут; 10 секунд


## Features

- Supports ~688 locales by means of [CLDR][lib-cldr] (built-in). See the [full list][locales]
- Provides three different time unit formats for each locale (`long`, `short`, `narrow`)
- Falls back to another unit type format if preferred one is not present in the target locale


## Usage

1. Require library
2. ???
3. Format!


### Examples

```javascript

var timeDelta = require('./lib/time-delta.js');

var instance = timeDelta.create({
  locale: 'en' // default
});

var date1 = new Date('2015-04-01T21:00:00');
var date2 = new Date('2015-04-01T23:17:10');

// Outputs: "2 hours, 17 minutes".
console.log(instance.format(date1, date2));

```

See [demo.js][demo] for more examples.


## Installation

It's exactly like you've already guessed:

`npm install --save time-delta` or `npm install --save-dev time-delta`.


## Configuration

The library accepts the following [configuration object][config]:

| Option              | Type                               | Default                                     | Description
|---------------------|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------
| locale              | `string`                           | `'en'`                                      | Locale to use. See the [full list][locales]
| span                | `integer`                          | `2`                                         | How much time units to include in the result
| delimiter           | `string`                           | `', '`                                      | Delimiter to use between time units
| unitType            | `string`                           | `'long'`                                    | Unit type format. One of `long`, `short` or `narrow`
| unitTypeLookupOrder | `array`                            | `['long', 'short', 'narrow']`               | Unit type lookup order (used for fallback)

You can pass config to factory method during instantiation:

`var instance = timeDelta.create(myInstanceConfig);`

You can also specify it for each call to `format()`:

`instance.format(date1, date2, myCallConfig);`
